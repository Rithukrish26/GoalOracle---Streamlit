The idea is simple: football is unpredictable, but math can give us probabilities. We use a concept called the Poisson distribution.

For example, if Team A usually scores 2 goals per match, the Poisson formula can tell us how likely they are to score 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. We do the same for Team B, then combine the two distributions into a probability matrix.

From that, we can calculate:

 -  The chance of Team A winning,

 -  The chance of a draw,

 -  The chance of Team B winning,
and even the most likely final score.


We enter team stats like goals scored, goals conceded, possession, and shots on target. When we click Predict, it instantly runs the math and shows the most probable scoreline and win/draw probabilities.

We also added a Reset button for quick re-use, and designed the app with a football-themed UI â€” clean, rounded boxes, team inputs, and even a pitch-style background.
